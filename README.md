# Refined Causality Extraction from Text

This repository contains the data and scripts used for refined causality extraction from text.

## Data

The [`data` directory](https://github.com/ANR-kFLOW/Relation_extraction/tree/main/data) contains the CausalSense datasets used in our experiments.

## Pipeline

In this directory, it is contained the pipeline, the API and the demo.
Please refer to the [paper](https://www.eurecom.fr/publication/8673) and to the README inside the folder.

## End-to-End Models

The `end_to_end_models` directory includes models used for training, specifically:

- **REBEL**
- **RoBERTa_end_to_end**

### Training Instructions

- **REBEL**:  
  - Train the REBEL model using:  

    ```bash
    python end_to_end_models/REBEL/train.py
    ```

  - Transform data into the format required for REBEL-based event relation extraction (ERE) using:  

    ```bash
    python end_to_end_models/REBEL/Data_transform.py
    ```

    *Ensure to adjust the script as needed for your dataset.*

- **RoBERTa_end_to_end**:  
  - Train the RoBERTa model for end-to-end event relation extraction using:  

    ```bash
    python end_to_end_models/RoBERTa_end_to_end/end_to_end_train.py
    ```

## Separate Task Training

For training each subtask in refined causality extraction, use the following scripts:

- **Relation Detection**:  

  ```bash
  python separate_tasks/Relation_detection.py
  ```

- **Relation Classification**:  

  ```bash
  python separate_tasks/relation_classification.py
  ```

- **Event Extraction**:  

  ```bash
  python separate_tasks/EE.py
  ```
